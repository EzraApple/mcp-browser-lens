# 🔍 MCP Browser Lens

**AI-powered browser automation and visual inspection** - Give your AI assistant eyes to see, capture, and analyze any webpage. One-line installation with automatic Chrome integration.

Turn any webpage into AI context instantly: *"Look at this Stripe pricing page and help me build something similar"* or *"Compare my localhost dashboard with this Notion page design"*.

## 🚀 **One-Line Installation**

Just add this to your `mcp.json` and restart your AI assistant:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcp-browser-lens": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "mcp-browser-lens"]
    }
  }
}
```

**That's it!** No cloning, no building, no setup required.

## ⚡ **What Happens Next?**

When you restart your AI assistant (Cursor, etc.):

✅ **MCP Browser Lens will be ready to:**
- Accept AI commands for browser automation
- Initialize Chrome debugging when first needed
- Capture, analyze, and extract web content on demand

**Smart Chrome Management**: Your AI assistant will automatically initialize Chrome debugging when it first needs to interact with browser tabs.

## 💬 Example AI Commands

Once configured, you can use natural language commands like:

```
"Take a screenshot of this page and suggest design improvements"

"Show me all my open tabs and summarize what's in each one"

"Extract the main navigation elements from this website"

"Compare this page layout with the Stripe pricing page"

"Help me debug the CSS issues on my localhost development site"

"Capture the checkout flow from this e-commerce site"

"Get the color palette and typography from this design system"
```

## 🌐 Browser Support

### ✅ **Currently Supported**
- **Chrome/Chromium** - Full support with intelligent debugging initialization

### 🔄 **Future Support** (Optional)
- **Safari** - WebKit Remote Inspector integration (complex setup)
- **Firefox/Zen** - Gecko debugging protocol support (different architecture)  
- **Arc Browser** - Chromium-based support (should work with Chrome provider)

> **Note**: Chrome provides the best debugging experience and widest compatibility. MCP Browser Lens intelligently manages Chrome debugging setup, launching Chrome with debugging when needed.

## 🖥️ System Requirements

- **Node.js** 18.0.0 or higher
- **Google Chrome** (any recent version)
- **macOS, Windows, or Linux**

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### 🚫 **Chrome Initialization Issues**

**Problem**: "Chrome debugging initialization failed" errors
```bash
# Check if Chrome is installed in standard locations:
ls -la "/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome"

# Or try manual launch:
/Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome --remote-debugging-port=9222
```

**Problem**: Permission denied when initializing Chrome
- On macOS, grant Terminal permission to control applications in System Preferences → Security & Privacy
- Try manually starting Chrome with debugging first

### 🔌 **Connection Issues**

**Problem**: "Browser not detected" errors
1. Check Chrome debugging port: `curl http://localhost:9222/json/version`
2. Ask your AI assistant to try initializing Chrome debugging
3. Manually quit Chrome (Cmd+Q) and let MCP initialize it fresh

**Problem**: Tabs not showing up
- Make sure Chrome is the active application
- Try refreshing the webpage
- Check that you have tabs actually open in Chrome

### ⚡ **Performance Issues**

**Problem**: Slow screenshot capture
- Close unnecessary browser tabs
- Ensure localhost development servers are responsive
- Try smaller screenshot areas using element selectors

## 🎯 Best Practices

### **For Web Development**
- Keep your localhost development server running
- Use descriptive tab titles for easier AI identification
- Open design inspiration in separate tabs for comparison

### **For Design Analysis**
- Navigate to the specific page/component before asking for analysis
- Use element extraction for specific UI components
- Take screenshots at different scroll positions for full page capture

### **For Content Research**
- Open multiple related pages for comparative analysis
- Use tab listing to let AI understand your research context
- Combine screenshots with HTML extraction for comprehensive understanding
